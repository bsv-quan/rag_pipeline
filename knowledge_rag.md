# Variants of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

In addition to **Multi-modal RAG**, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has various forms and variants developed to address specific needs or enhance performance in different scenarios. Below are the different variants of RAG:

## 1. Standard RAG
- **Description**: The most basic form of RAG, focusing on combining information retrieval and text generation.
- **How it works**:
  - **Retrieval**: Uses an embedding model to convert queries and documents into vectors, then searches for relevant documents in a text-based database.
  - **Generation**: A large language model (LLM) uses the retrieved information to generate a response.
- **Applications**: Answering questions based on documents, intelligent chatbots, and information search support.
- **Example**: Answering a question like "Who was the U.S. president in 2020?" by retrieving information from a text document database.

## 2. Hybrid RAG
- **Description**: Combines RAG with other search methods (e.g., traditional keyword search or semantic search) to improve accuracy and efficiency.
- **How it works**:
  - Integrates multiple retrieval strategies (e.g., BM25 for keyword search and vector search for semantic search).
  - The generation model uses results from multiple retrieval sources to produce a response.
- **Advantages**: Enhances accuracy by leveraging both semantic and keyword-specific information.
- **Applications**: Complex search systems, such as legal or medical document retrieval.

## 3. Iterative RAG
- **Description**: Performs multiple rounds of retrieval and generation to refine answers, especially for complex queries or when information is needed from multiple sources.
- **How it works**:
  - After initial retrieval, the system evaluates the response and conducts additional retrieval rounds if needed to supplement information.
  - The model may generate sub-questions to clarify or expand the original query.
- **Advantages**: Suitable for complex questions requiring deep analysis or synthesis from multiple sources.
- **Applications**: Analyzing long documents, answering scientific research questions.

## 4. Contextual RAG
- **Description**: Enhances context understanding by retaining and using conversation history or additional contextual information.
- **How it works**:
  - The system stores conversation history or contextual information from previous interactions.
  - Uses this context to refine queries or retrieve more relevant information.
- **Advantages**: Improves continuity and personalization in extended conversations.
- **Applications**: Conversational chatbots, AI personal assistants.

## 5. Knowledge Graph RAG
- **Description**: Uses a knowledge graph instead of or in combination with a text database for information retrieval.
- **How it works**:
  - Maps queries to nodes and relationships in a knowledge graph.
  - Information from the knowledge graph is used to enhance the generation model's response.
- **Advantages**: Provides structured information, particularly useful for domains like medicine, science, or entity relationships.
- **Applications**: Answering questions about relationships (e.g., "Which company owns WhatsApp?") or analyzing structured data.

## 6. Adaptive RAG
- **Description**: Automatically adjusts retrieval and generation strategies based on the query or data characteristics.
- **How it works**:
  - Evaluates query complexity and selects the appropriate retrieval strategy (e.g., vector search for semantic queries or keyword search for specific queries).
  - May switch between generation models or adjust parameters based on context.
- **Advantages**: Flexible, optimizing performance for different query types.
- **Applications**: General-purpose AI systems, such as versatile virtual assistants.

## 7. Hierarchical RAG
- **Description**: Uses a hierarchical approach to retrieve information, from general to specific.
- **How it works**:
  - First retrieves general documents or information related to the query.
  - Then performs more detailed retrieval within the scope of selected documents.
  - The generation model uses hierarchical information to produce accurate responses.
- **Advantages**: Reduces retrieval of irrelevant information, improving efficiency.
- **Applications**: Analyzing long documents, such as books or research reports.

## 8. Self-RAG
- **Description**: The model self-evaluates and improves its responses through a reflection process.
- **How it works**:
  - After generating an initial response, the model checks its accuracy or completeness.
  - If needed, the system performs additional retrieval or adjusts the response based on internal feedback.
- **Advantages**: Increases accuracy and reduces the risk of incorrect responses (hallucination).
- **Applications**: Systems requiring high accuracy, such as medical or legal consultation.

## 9. Federated RAG
- **Description**: Retrieves information from multiple distributed data sources (e.g., internal databases, the web, or public document repositories).
- **How it works**:
  - The system retrieves information from various sources and aggregates them.
  - The generation model uses aggregated information to produce a response.
- **Advantages**: Leverages diverse data sources, enhancing response richness.
- **Applications**: Web-based information search, analyzing data from multiple organizations.
